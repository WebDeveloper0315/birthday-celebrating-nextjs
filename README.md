## :worried: Issues that have to work out in the next step
-   This project was constructed with TypeScript, but [this file](app/%5Bname%5D/page.js) is JavaScript file.<br>
I want to convert this file as TypeScript file, but I couldn't. <br>
Don't worry... This project runs well.
-   When I input the name with space (For example: [Jhon Smith]()), this shows as [Jhon%20Smith]().

## :thumbsup: Acknowledgements
**This was based on the *[Gourav Khunger](https://github.com/gouravkhunger/nextjs-birthday-wish)*'s project.**
<br>I upgraded to [Next.js 13.5.4](https://nextjs.org/) and [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs).
